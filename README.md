# .emacs.d
This is going to be the configuration file of my emacs. I'll try to use it only in terminal, but let's see if that works :)

# some update at 22.07.2023
I was on the Europython conference in Prague this year that I got presented with the editor Helix. I tried to use this editor it for a couple of hours and then I have noticed that I still needed to configure the git authentification to work from the terminal (using SSH).

After finally being able to properly configure the git authentification I asked myself: "Why I'm not using emacs in the terminal, if the git authentification was what was keeping me to use it in the past?". So I switched back to emacs!
